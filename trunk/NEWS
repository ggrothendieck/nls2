VERSION 0.1-3

o nls2.Rd improvements

o added algorithm = "random" which samples maxiter rows from start if
  start is a data frame with more than 2 rows whereas if start is a data
  frame with exactly 2 rows it will take maxiter random points from the
  rectangle whose boundary is defined by the rows.

o a maximum rather than a minimum of maxiter starting values are 
  generated - todo

o if start is a data frame with n+1 rows where n is the number of
  parameters to optimize then Nelder Mead is used first - todo

o if plinear then brute force should optimize over nonlinear portion
  and use lm to get linear portion - todo

o add minpack.lm interface - todo

VERSION 0.1-2

o fixed problem with update not working with objects produced by nls2.

o fixed number of iterations and tolerance displayed when using
  algorithm = "brute-force".

o if there are exactly two rows in start= then a grid of starting values
  is formed so that there are at least maxiter points on the grid.

o start can be an nls object in which case coef(nls) is used.

VERSION 0.1-1

o documentation and DESCRIPTION file tweaks.

VERSION 0.1-0

o initial release.
